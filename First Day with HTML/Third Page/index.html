		<p>Tetris is a hard game and takes much time to master. But these are a few tricks that I picked up on that might help you get better quicker.</p>
		<p>This a guide for the modern tetris game.<strong> Not the orginal in 1984.</strong></p>
		<h3>Just starting out :</h3>
		<p>If you want any beginner tips and if you are new to tetris this section is for you.</p>
		<p>To get the <strong>most points</strong> you need to get a 'tetris' which is clearing four lines all at once. This can only be done by a line piece. 
		To make this possible the player needs to place the rest of the pieces on one side with one unit of space on the opposite side.</p>
		<p>If there is a line piece and you aren't ready for a tetris then hold the piece. If you mess up and it ruins your rythum then don't focus on getting a tetris and use the
		 line piece to your advantage.</p>
		<h3>Getting more Advanced :</h3>
		<p>In order to become better at tetris there are certain things that the player needs to understand.</p>
		<p>Looking ahead, this can be a difficult thing to get good at because if the pieces are moving too fast you will accually perform worse.
		 Looking ahead consists of looking at the next piece in the que and placing the active piece into a slot that allows the next piece to be placed in the best location.</p>
		<p>Another thing is the ablity to do spins that seem impossible to new players. This is when the player inserts piece into an unreachable slot by spinning the piece.
		This is how <strong>T-spins</strong> are performed, and if you are not aware a <strong>T-spin</strong> is fill free to look it up, because I couldn't explain it well.</p>
