        <h3 style="text-align: center;">My name is Connor Paxman and this is a Webpage about myself.</h3>

        <p>
            I like to code and make small little projects that I never really show anybody. The langauges that I know are
            <strong>HTML / CSS / Javascript, Python, GDscript, and C#.</strong> The language that I am the most familar with is Python being the
            first language that I learned. The second language, or languages that I learn was HTML / CSS / Javascript, I put these
            all in bundle because HTML and CSS aren't really coding languages. I learned a little of C#, just for Unity development,
             but I haven't been using it latly because my computer can't really run Unity well. This leds me to the last most recent
            coding language I learned and still learning GDscript which is with the Godot game engine.

            I really enjoy running and am participating in the Cross Country and Track Teams at <strong>Grantsville High School. </strong>
            Right now I am at the top of the boys varsity team for Cross Country and don't plan on being taken down. 
            I didn't really get to run in Track in 2020, but I hope that they don't cancel the next season in 2021. 
            Really the main reason why I run is because I'm not that good at any other sports, and not very corrdinated. 
            I think I will be running in collage and if not then I will surely be there to run half to full marathons, or shorter road races.

            The last thing on this list is that I really like to draw and or create art.
            I have been drawing as a hobby sence I was in middle school, there have been dry period where I don't draw as often, but I has been farly consistent.
            I mostly create art with pencil and paper, I never like to add color, but sometimes it's neccessary to make something look cooler.
            The only time I'm not drawing I'm painting using watercolors, I love the look of water colors and it is easier to paint with than acrilic.
            There is this drawing event each year since 2016 called <strong>Inktober</strong>, this event is the everyday of October you make a drawing that is related to the propt and use any ink draw device in order to create it.
            I perticapated as much as I this year and go a good amount of drawings out.
